## Troubleshooting

### I Can't Find My Organization

CodeHub can see all organizations *if they are granted access*. GitHub, by default, disables [third-party access](https://help.github.com/articles/about-third-party-application-restrictions/) for new organizations. Because of this, CodeHub has no knowledge that those organizations even exist. GitHub keeps that information from the app. There are several ways to correct this. If you own the organization follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/enabling-third-party-application-restrictions-for-your-organization/). If you do not own the organization you can request access for CodeHub by following [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/requesting-organization-approval-for-third-party-applications/).

### I Can't Find My Repository

If these repositories belong to an organization then your problem is most likely due to the issue above. Please consult it for a remedy.

If they do not belong to an organization then something is not right. Please file a ticket.'
